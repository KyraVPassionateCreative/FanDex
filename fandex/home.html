At this wonderful- well... hopefully you agree that this is a wonderful place to be. Now moving on since things got complicated to segway and to avoid awkward tension, I'll just change the subject after cringefully calling myself out just now.
</p>

<p>
  Here at FanDex, it is our true passion to do as much research as we can on all the most updated information about all the Asian Celebrity news and Profile Basic Information for fans that are curious about their "faves".
  With as much research we do here, we also like to make sure that our audience is kept entertained through the video page that you can find in the navigation bar above, where we consistently change out videos to expose this growing "yellow fever fandom" to.
</p>

<p><strong>Note: Unfortunately, it is a big issue with new fans that are in the stan stage of their infatuation with asian celebrities where they become so off put by a generally attractive asian celebrity but not Korean. Since South Korea has recently taken over the Western World and hoenstly the entire world by storm-
It is part of our personal morals to be able to expose stans to other cultures and other asian heritages. There's Middle Eastern people that are honestly South Asian when you think about it and possibly Eurasian depending on where they're from. There's South Asian People, Southeast- etc. etc. I can go on- but I will not.
</p></strong>

  Thanks for coming to our TedTalk and introduction to the website. We hope to see you more soon, and stay tuned because the webpage will be going through some major updates in the upcoming months ahead. Back to you universe.
